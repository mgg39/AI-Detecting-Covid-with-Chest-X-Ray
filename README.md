# AI-Detecting-Covid-with-Chest-X-Ray
This Neural Network has been trained with multiple X rays of patients with different conditions to recognize whenever or not they suffer from Covid.
The dataset used has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans, categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19.
The used model is a ResNet-18 model in PyTorch that performs Image Classification.
Please note this code cannot accurately diagnose Covid-19.
